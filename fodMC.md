# Instalation

Available at
https://gitlab.com/opensic/fodMC

**It needs a FORTRAN compiler installed**

Macs: Install homebrew (https://brew.sh) 

After brew is installed:

`brew install gfortran` (takes a few minutes)

Linux:

Check that a FORTRAN version is installed

***

**Install fodMC:**

This is the fodMC code that we will be using.

`python3.10 -m pip install fodMC`

Or use any Python>=3.10.

> [!TIP]
> for some MAcs you may need:
> 
> `python3.10 -m pip install wheel`
> 
> `python3.10 -m pip install --no-build-isolation fodMC`


***

**Install RDKit:**

RDKit is a toolkit for cheminformatics. We will use it to extract bonding information, to manipulate molecular files, and to convert SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System)
to 3D molecules. 


`python3.10  -m pip install rdkit`


***

**Install atomic simulation environment (ASE) package:**

ASE is a library for atomistic modeling and simulation. We will use it.

`python3.10 -m pip install ase`.

# Example 01

Generate FODs from an xyz file and connectivity (bonding) information.

Download the file [01test.py](/01test.py)

+ Use an xyz file and add the “connectivity” by hand. In this case it is already in the python script.
+ Run fodMC: `python3 01test.py`
+ The script will read the file `acetaldehyde.xyz` with the atomic coordinates in xyz format.
+ The script generates a file `acetaldehyde_fodMC.xyz` with the atomic coordinates plus the FODs.
+ The script also generate a file `fodMC.out` with internal information (useful for debugging if needed).
> [!NOTE]
>The spin-up FODs are labeled as X and the spin-down as He in the original fodMC code.
> There is a segment of code in the script at the end that replaces He-->Z in the file.  
+ Visualize using VESTA (or other)

> [!Note]
>Are there any FODs inside the atomic sphere representation?

# Example 02

Generate FODs from an xyz file

Download the file [02test.py](/02test.py)


+ Now use the xyz file and RDKit to generate the connectivity. There is no need to know the molecular connectivity.
+ Run fodMC: `python3 02test.py`.
+ The script generates two files: `acetaldehyde.mol` (including connectivity information) and the `acetaldehyde_fodMC.xyz` file as before.

> [!Warning]
> The script [02test.py](/02test.py) will overwrite the files generated by the script [01test.py](/01test.py).

+ Visualize using VESTA (or other).


> [!Note]
> What is the difference with the previous test?

# Example 03 

Generate FODs from a SMILES string

Download the file [03test.py](/03test.py)

+ Generate xyz coordinates and connectivity directly from a SMILES string. In this case we only need a string that represent the molecule. The script takes care of:
  + SMILES &#8594; mol. The SMILES strin for acetaldehyde is `CC=O`.
  + Add Hs (not in the SMILES information).
  + Adjust structure.
  + Relax using UFF.

+ The resulting mol and connectivity is used for fodMC.
+ Run fodMC: `python3 03test.py`.
+ The script generates a file `CC=O_fodMC.xyz` with the atomic coordinates plus the FODs.


> [!Warning]
> The script [03test.py](/03test.py) will overwrite files.


+ Visualize using VESTA (or other)
